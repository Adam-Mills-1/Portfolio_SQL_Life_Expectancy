# Portfolio_SQL_Life_Expectancy

In this project we will examine some trends in human life expectancy from the mid 20th century to today accross several countries. The data we are using is acquired from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development at data.OECD.org and data.worldbank.org. Along with life expectancy data we also look at several typical life expectancy predictors such as health spending, smoking rates and child vaccination rates.

In part 1 we clean, restructure and prepare the data using SQL.

In part 2 we create visualisations and an interactive dashboard with the data using the software tableau.

The interactive dashboard that was made using the data produced by this project can be viewed here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adam.mills4584/viz/LifeExpectancyDashboard_16602229457180/Dashboard1
